# A* Pathfinding AlgoritmasÄ±

This project is an application that finds the shortest path between two points using the A (A-Star) Pathfinding* algorithm. 
The A* algorithm is an efficient pathfinding algorithm used in various fields such as mapping, game development, and robotics.

#

In the video below, you can see the working process of the A* Pathfinding algorithm.
The algorithm determines a target from the starting point to the endpoint and creates a route.
By navigating around obstacles, the system calculates the most efficient path and can be used in game development and map-based applications.
